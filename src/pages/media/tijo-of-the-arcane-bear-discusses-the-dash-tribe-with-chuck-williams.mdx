  description: `After our chats with Chuck Dash has been added as one of our favourite new tokens and ideas. When we see this type of empathic behaviour its inspiring to see where we could go if we are all a little more connected to nature and our emotions. From the future of technology, blockchain and money to our thoughts on the nature of consciousness, it was great to have such a well rounded improv conversation with this wonderful soul.`,
