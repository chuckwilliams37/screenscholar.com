    'Digital Cash Rundown 42 with Chuck Williams: ETH Pool Suspends Operations, THORChain is Back & More!',
  date: '2021-10-01',
  description:
    'Chief Experience Officer for Flote Chuck Williams comes on the Digital Cash Rundown to talk all things new with crypto, including of course the THORChain re-activation after months of downtime due to several significant hacks. We also go over the second-largest Ethereum mining pool suspending operations due to China&apos;s ongoing crypto crackdown, and what that will mean for the ecosystem. Finally we go deep into the shifting geopolitics thanks to crypto, as well as how governments around the world are struggling to keep up with the way the world is going, and how future systems will end up radically different from what they are today.',
