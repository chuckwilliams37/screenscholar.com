  date: '2022-02-11',
  description:
    'The incomparable Chuck Williams, Chief Experience Officer at Flote (which is launching its own NFTs soon), comes on the Digital Cash Rundown to talk about all things crypto, including of course a great NFT discussion, followed by the Ethereum 2.0 Altair upgrade, one moment closer to the full ETH 2.0 release, and its prospects at reaching the top of the crypto rankings. We also talked about the Canadian trucker convoy and the seizure of its GoFundMe donations, and how cryptocurrencies can fix that. Finally, we talk about the DashDirect release of the virtual MasterCard in the public beta form, which lets anyone spend Dash anywhere in the US privately and with no custody.',
