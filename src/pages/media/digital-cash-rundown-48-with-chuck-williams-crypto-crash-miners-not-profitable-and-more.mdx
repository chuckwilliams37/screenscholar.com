  description:
    'Chuck Williams comes back on the Digital Cash Rundown to talk about all the latest crypto headlines, including of course the notorious crypto crash we&apos;re in, but mainly pushback from officials on crypto&apos;s ability to skirt sanctions, as well as tax revenue, for example from miners in Kazakhstan. But mainly we go into a deep dive into how cities and governments can tokenize, and do things such as sell governance tokens and NFTs instead of imposing taxation.',
