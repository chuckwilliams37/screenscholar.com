  description:
    'The one and only Chuck Williams comes back on the podcast to talk the latest crypto happenings! In this installment we go deep into regulation, not just the SEC seeking to regulate crypto exchanges, but on the long-term game plan of regulators as they face a world which is slowly slipping from their fingers. We go into Elon Musk and the Bitcoin energy expenditure conundrum, as well as its origins in the struggles of geopolitics. We also go way deep down the rabbit hole on what to expect from humanity over the next decade as a new cycle begins.',
