    'Digital Cash Rundown 34 with Chuck Williams: Crypto Infrastructure Bill, Monero Lead Arrested and More!',
  date: '2021-08-06',
  description:
    'Chief Experience Officer of Flote, Chuck Williams, comes on the Digital Cash Rundown to rant about all the crazy stuff going on in the crypto world today, including Venezuela issuing another central bank digital currency (CBDC), including cutting off six zeroes from the supply. But we spend most of the time talking about the new US infrastructure bill, and the proposed regulations on cryptocurrency, which could completely hamper the industry in the US if passed. Finally, we dropped the giant Monero and Fluffy Pony bombshell over his arrest, and a possible dangerous honeypot in the form of the MyMonero wallet and infrastructure. A must-listen for sure!',
