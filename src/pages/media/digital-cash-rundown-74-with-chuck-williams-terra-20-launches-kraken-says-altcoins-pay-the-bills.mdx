    'Digital Cash Rundown 74 with Chuck Williams: Terra 2.0 Launches, Kraken Says Altcoins "Pay the Bills"',
  date: '2022-06-03',
  description:
    'The incomparable Chuck Williams of Flote comes back on the Digital Cash Rundown to talk all things crypto, including of course the Terra 2.0 launch/relaunch, and what value proposition remains after the death of its stablecoin offering, UST. We also go into the crypto bear market causing layoffs from many major companies, as well as Kraken stating the obvious to Bitcoin purists that altcoin trading is what actually pays the bills. Finally we touch on Japan finally leading the way in regulating stablecoins.',
